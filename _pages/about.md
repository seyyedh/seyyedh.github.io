I am a researcher and educator with a passion for <b> high-performance computing </b>, <b> machine learning </b>, and <b> network science</b>. My academic journey began with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Farhangian University, where I discovered how concepts like graphs, probability, and statistics could be applied to solve real-world computational challenges. This realization ignited my enthusiasm for computer science and motivated me to pursue a master’s degree in computer engineering. During this time, I explored advanced topics such as parallel systems architecture, fault-tolerant design, and dynamic networks, which deepened my understanding of high-performance computing and its potential to tackle complex problems.

In my master’s research, I focused on addressing network congestion using reinforcement learning. I developed a decentralized routing algorithm designed to optimize network throughput, validated through a custom-built Python-based simulator. Alongside this, I gained hands-on experience with hardware-level programming languages like Verilog and tools such as INTEL HLS, further enhancing my expertise in computer architecture and system design. My experiences also extended to teaching, where I served as a teaching assistant, helping students navigate challenging concepts and fostering a collaborative learning environment.
